# React Project Setup

This guide provides instructions to set up and run a React project on your local machine. The project also includes Sass as a dependency for styling.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

-   Node.js (v12 or later)
-   npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1.  Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```
     git clone <repository_url>` 
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ```
     cd <project_directory>
    ``` 
    
3.  Install project dependencies by running the following command:
    
    ``` 
     npm install
    ```  
    

## Usage

To run the React project locally, follow these steps:

1.  Start the development server:

    ``` 
     npm start 
    ``` 
    This command will compile the project and start a local development server.
    
2.  Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. The React application should be up and running.
    

## Styling with Sass

This project uses Sass as a preprocessor for CSS. Sass files are located in the `src/styles/styles.sccs` directory. To compile Sass into CSS, follow these steps:

1.  Run the following command in your project directory:
    
```
 npm run build-css
``` 


This command will compile Sass files and generate corresponding CSS files in the `src/styles/styles.sccs` directory.
    
2.  Link the generated CSS files in your React components to apply the styles.
    

## Additional Scripts

The project includes additional scripts that you can run using the `npm run` command:

-   `test`: Run tests for the project.
-   `build`: Build the project for production.
-   `eject`: Eject the project configuration from create-react-app.

## Conclusion

You should now have the React project set up on your local machine. Feel free to explore and modify the code to meet your requirements. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the project's documentation or seek support from the project's maintainers.
